## About

### Overview

PaPyrus is a memo application like sticky note. It makes your work boost by just putting it on desktop.
It is easy to use and you don't need to think about many things which general memo apps has such as category, tag, title and so on.

You can use this app as if it is Snapchat or Story on Instagram.

### Why I made

There are a lot of awesome memo applications in the world but I didn't satisfy those applications because
My almost notes are likely to be short-lived and not to be reviewed again.
Almost applications have too many features to match with this useage.

That is why I had been wanting a application managing short-lived memos and made it.

I hope that you like this app and frendly feedback.
